My original DirectX 2D game for school work.
Currently just rewritting in C++ and also trying to architecture it "abit" better so it's not looks like the total garbege it does right now.

Done:  
  Abstracted window class, so the entry point can be less messy;
  //It's marginally better now only just after pulling out all the win32 stuff from it. Wish it was like this in the first place.
  Outline for the sprite2D system class;
  Started to do a wrapper for the directX math so I don't have to include it everywhere and also some functions so the code won't be a pile of mess whenever I try to do math;

To do:
  Code better;
  System manager so I can start to plan a better architecture instead of using this pile of doodoo;
  Implement object component system so I can decouple all the stuff and free myself from this stupid entangled mess;
  Many more...
